# Training Program for Solidity and Cairo 0 Developers: Transition to Cairo 1.0

In this two-week training program, we aim to help Solidity and Cairo 0 developers transition to Cairo 1.0 by working on three crypto application layer projects. Each developer will choose one of the three challenges and implement it within the first week. During the second week, developers will review and audit each other's implementations, while also participating in daily one-hour sessions to discuss any questions or challenges that arise. By the end of this program, developers should be well-versed in Cairo 1.0 and ready to take on more advanced projects.

## Challenge 1: Decentralized Savings Account (DeFi)

**Project Description:**  
Develop a decentralized savings account platform that allows users to deposit cryptocurrency and earn interest on their deposits. This platform will use smart contracts to pool funds from depositors and automatically lend them to borrowers in the market, generating interest that can be distributed to depositors.

**Key Features:**
1. Allow users to deposit and withdraw funds in different cryptocurrencies.
2. Implement smart contracts to manage pooled funds and lending.
3. Determine the interest rate algorithmically, based on supply and demand.
4. Provide a user interface to track deposited funds and interest earned.

## Challenge 2: NFT Marketplace (NFT)

**Project Description:**  
Create a simple NFT marketplace that allows users to create, buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets, represented as non-fungible tokens. The marketplace should facilitate the minting of new NFTs, as well as the browsing and purchasing of existing NFTs.

**Key Features:**
1. User registration and authentication system.
2. NFT minting functionality, allowing users to create new NFTs from digital files (e.g. images, videos, audio).
3. Browsing and searching functionality for listed NFTs.
4. Implement smart contracts to manage the buying, selling, and trading of NFTs.

## Challenge 3: Decentralized Voting System (Crypto Application Layer)

**Project Description:**  
Design a decentralized voting system using blockchain technology to ensure transparent, secure, and tamper-proof voting. The system should allow users to create polls and vote on them, while ensuring that each user can only vote once per poll.

**Key Features:**
1. User registration and authentication system.
2. Create and manage polls, including options and voting periods.
3. Implement smart contracts to manage voting and prevent double-voting.
4. Store vote data on the blockchain to ensure transparency and immutability.
5. Provide a user interface to create polls, vote, and view poll results.

## Challenge 4: NFT Ticketing Platform

**Project Description:**  
Develop an NFT ticketing platform that allows event organizers to issue, sell, and manage digital tickets represented as non-fungible tokens. The platform should offer configurable options to control ticket transferability, transfer fees, and other customizable parameters.

**Key Features:**
1. User registration and authentication system for event organizers and attendees.
2. Functionality for event organizers to create and manage events, including event details, ticket pricing, and total ticket supply.
3. Implement smart contracts to mint NFT tickets, manage ticket sales, and enforce customizable rules such as transferability and transfer fees.
4. Allow users to buy, sell, and transfer NFT tickets, while adhering to the rules set by the event organizer.
5. Provide a user interface for event organizers to configure ticket options, and for users to browse, purchase, and manage their tickets.

**Configurable Options:**
1. Ticket transferability: Allow event organizers to set whether tickets can be transferred between users or not.
2. Transfer fee: If ticket transfers are allowed, enable organizers to set a fee (either a fixed amount or a percentage) to be paid to the ticket issuer upon each transfer.
3. Ticket refund policy: Allow organizers to specify a refund policy for their event, such as a deadline for refunds or a partial refund percentage.
4. Additional customizable parameters as needed, to accommodate specific event requirements or preferences.

## Submission and Review Process

At the beginning of the training program, each developer should create a new branch in the project repository with a clear naming convention, such as `<developer_name>_challenge_<number>`. For example, if Jane Doe worked on Challenge 1, her branch would be named `jane_doe_challenge_1`. Throughout the week, developers can push their progress to this branch, allowing others to monitor and provide early feedback.

When reviewing your colleagues' work, approach the process with the mindset of an audit. Carefully scrutinize the code for potential mistakes, security vulnerabilities, and areas where improvements could be made. Constructive criticism and suggestions for enhancements are highly encouraged.

### Collaboration and Exploration

We encourage developers to explore different tools and approaches during this training program. Feel free to collaborate and discuss your implementation with other team members. Sharing insights and learning from each other's experiences can be highly beneficial and lead to more robust solutions.

### Alternative Projects

The provided challenges serve as recommendations to help developers transition to Cairo 1.0. However, if you have a different project idea that you'd like to work on, please feel free to pursue it. Ensure that you share your alternative project with the team, so others are aware of your work and can provide feedback or collaborate as needed.
